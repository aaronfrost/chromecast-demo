chromecast-demo
===============

This is the demo that I prepared for the GDG Utah - August Meetup.

If you would like to have me help you present this, please find me on Google+ or on the GDG Organizers forums.

The presentation runs in steps. Checkout the branches one at a time and walk through it.

step1, step2, step3, and finally step4, in that order.

step3 and step4 will require that you have a receiver app configured with Google's Chomecast Whitelist.
